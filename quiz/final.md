1. What is the best definition of Structural patterns?
A. This type of patterns provides a way to create interfaces and define ways to compose
objects to obtain new functionalities.
B. This type of patterns provides an ability to hide creation logic instead of using new
operator.
C. This type of patterns is specifically concerned with communication between objects.
D. This type of patterns is specifically concerned with the presentation tier.

Answer: A.

2. What is related to Structural patterns? Multiple options available.
A. Structural patterns are concerned with how objects and classes communicate with each
other.
B. Structural patterns hide how instances of classes are created and put together.
C. Structural patterns describe ways to compose objects to realize new functionality.
D. Structural patterns show ways how classes and objects are composed to form larger
structures.
E. Structural patterns encapsulate knowledge about which concrete classes the system uses.
F. Structural patterns describe how different objects work together to accomplish a task.

Answer: C, D, E.

3. What from the following code issues can be solved with Structural Patterns? Multiple
answers possible.
A. Algorithm implementation contains too many special case logic and conditional
statements.
B. Different methods in subclass do semantically similar steps except for creating objects.
C. Creation code is duplicated in different methods.
D. Class contains hard-coded logic to notify other classes.
E. Creation logic is sprawled among many classes.
F. Classes implement the same of similar steps and have different interface which make client
code complicated, since it has to work with both interfaces.
G. Class has new responsibility which is additional to its base responsibility which makes the
class very big.

Answer: F, G.
