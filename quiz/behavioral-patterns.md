# Behavioral patterns

1. Which of the following describes the Command pattern correctly?
A. This pattern is used to get a way to access the elements of a collection object in sequential
manner without any need to know its underlying representation.
B. This pattern creates a chain of receiver objects for a request.
C. This pattern provides a way to evaluate language grammar or expression.
D. In this pattern a request is wrapped under an object as command and passed to invoker
object.

Answer: D.

2. Which Design Pattern should you use when many related classes differ only in their
behavior, or you need different variants of an algorithm?
A. Command.
B. Strategy.
C. Iterator.
D. Observer.

Answer: B (Strategy).

3. Which Design Pattern should you use when you want to access an aggregate object's
contents without exposing its internal representation? Aggregate object means an object,
which contains a collection of other objects.
A. Template Method
B. Iterator.
C. Strategy.
D. Mediator.

Answer: B (Iterator).

4. Which Design Pattern should you use when there is a language to interpret, and you can
represent statements in the language as abstract syntax trees.
A. Mediator.
B. Strategy.
C. Interpreter.
D. Chain of responsibility. 

Answer: C (Interpreter).

5. Which Design Pattern should you use when a set of objects communicate in well-defined
but complex ways. The resulting interdependencies are unstructured and difficult to
understand.
A. Adapter.
B. Mediator.
C. Template Method.
D. Iterator.

Answer: B (Mediator).

6. Which Design Pattern should you use when an object should be able to notify other
objects without making assumptions about who these objects are. In other words, you don't
want these objects tightly coupled.
A. Command.
B. Adapter.
C. Observer.
D. Chain of Responsibility.

Answer: C (Observer).

7. Which Design Pattern should you use when more than one object may handle a request,
and the handler is not known a priori. The handler should be ascertained automatically.
A. Observer.
B. Chain of Responsibility.
C. Adapter.
D. Mediator.

Answer: B (Chain of Responsibility).

8. Which Design Pattern should you use when an object's behavior depends on its state, and
it must change its behavior at run-time depending on that state.
A. Mediator.
B. Adapter.
C. State.
D. Observer.

Answer: C (State).
